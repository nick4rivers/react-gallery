# React Gallery App

_Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Tech Degree - Project 7_

This is my 7th project on the full stack javascript tech. degree path, and a great introduction to REACT. What we have is just a simple photo search app. You can search some of my favorite activities using the navigation menu, or search for whatever you want using the search input.

- _REACT_ - Using Create-React-App to start a new project
- _React-Router_ - Using react-router to render components and build in navigation.
- _FETCH_ - Using Fetch to make API requests within REACT.
